# LamaLib
A library that I created to control VRC robots in the 2020-2021 season: Tipping Point.
Nowhere near ready and no plan to release any time soon either.

No guarantee that everything works. There are lots of improvements to be made to the algorithms, some that I have made on my Github for my current team.

Created during my time at Caution Tape 839.

The disply code (I do not believe is functioning properly right now as we were not able to complete it before we left) by James Fu. The rest is by Noah Sun (Thats me!).
